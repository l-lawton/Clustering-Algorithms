# Clustering-Algorithms

1. Implement k-means clustering algorithm and cluster the dataset provided using it. Vary the value of k from 1 to 9 and compute the Silhouette coefficient for each set of clusters. Plot k in the horizontal axis and the Silhouette coefficient in the vertical axis in the same plot.

2. Generate synthetic data of same size (i.e. same number of data points) as the dataset provided and use this data to cluster K Means. Plot k in the horizontal axis and the Silhouette coefficient in the vertical axis in the same plot.

3. Implement k-means++ clustering algorithm and cluster the dataset provided using it. Vary the value of k from 1 to 9 and compute the Silhouette coefficient for each set of clusters. Plot k in the horizontal axis and the Silhouette coefficient in the vertical axis in the same plot.

4. Implement the Bisecting k-Means algorithm to compute a hierarchy of clusterings that refines the initial single cluster to 9 clusters. For each s from 1 to 9, extract from the hierarchy of clusterings the clustering with s clusters and compute the Silhouette coefficient for this clustering. Plot s in the horizontal axis and the Silhouette coefficient in the vertical axis in the same plot.

6. For the same clusters as in Figure 1, compute B-CUBED Precision, Recall, and F-score
